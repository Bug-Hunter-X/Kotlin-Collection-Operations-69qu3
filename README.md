# Kotlin Collection Operations Example

This repository contains a simple Kotlin program demonstrating common operations on collections (Lists) using Kotlin's standard library functions.  The code includes examples of mapping, filtering, summing, averaging, finding first/last elements matching a condition, and checking for the existence of elements matching a condition.  This is a useful example for understanding fundamental collection processing in Kotlin.
